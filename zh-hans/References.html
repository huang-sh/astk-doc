Here we present SUPPA2, a new method that addresses these challenges, and enables streamlined analysis across multiple conditions taking into account biological variability. Using experimental and simulated data, we show that SUPPA2 achieves higher accuracy compared to other methods, especially at low sequencing depth and short read length. We use SUPPA2 to identify novel Transformer2-regulated exons, novel microexons induced during differentiation of bipolar neurons, and novel intron retention events during erythroblast differentiation.","PAGES":"40","ISSN":"1474-760X","NUMBER":"1","KEYWORDS":"Alternative splicing, Biological variability, Differential splicing, Differentiation, RNA-seq, Uncertainty","AUTHOR":"Trincado, Juan L. and Entizne, Juan C. and Hysenaj, Gerald and Singh, Babita and Skalic, Miha and Elliott, David J. and Eyras, Eduardo","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1417-1","JOURNAL":"Genome Biology","TITLE":"{SUPPA2}: fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware differential splicing analysis across multiple conditions","VOLUME":"19","FILE":"Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\W5F9WY55\\\\Trincado 等。 - 2018 - SUPPA2 fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware diff.pdf:application/pdf;Snapshot:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\DXIH3HYZ\\\\s13059-018-1417-1.html:text/html","SHORTTITLE":"{SUPPA2}","YEAR":"2018","URLDATE":"2021-08-12","DOI":"10.1186/s13059-018-1417-1"}},{"citationKey":"YEO_MAXIMUM_NODATE_2004","entryType":"ARTICLE","entryTags":{"TITLE":"Maximum {Entropy} {Modeling} of {Short} {Sequence} {Motifs} with {Applications} to {RNA} {Splicing} {Signals}","ABSTRACT":"We propose a framework for modeling sequence motifs based on the maximum entropy principle (MEP). We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are speciﬁed by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classiﬁcation performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5 (donor) and 3 (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.","LANGUAGE":"en","AUTHOR":"Yeo, Gene and Burge, Christopher B","PAGES":"18","YEAR":"2004","FILE":"Yeo and Burge - Maximum Entropy Modeling of Short Sequence Motifs .pdf:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\BPJ5VRGT\\\\Yeo and Burge - Maximum Entropy Modeling of Short Sequence Motifs .pdf:application/pdf"}},{"citationKey":"LOUADI_FUNCTIONAL_2021","entryType":"ARTICLE","entryTags":{"MONTH":"December","ABSTRACT":"Alternative splicing (AS) is an important aspect of gene regulation. Nevertheless, its role in molecular processes and pathobiology is far from understood. A roadblock is that tools for the functional analysis of AS-set events are lacking. To mitigate this, we developed NEASE, a tool integrating pathways with structural annotations of protein-protein interactions to functionally characterize AS events. We show in four application cases how NEASE can identify pathways contributing to tissue identity and cell type development, and how it highlights splicing-related biomarkers. With a unique view on AS, NEASE generates unique and meaningful biological insights complementary to classical pathways analysis.","PAGES":"327","ISSN":"1474-760X","NUMBER":"1","KEYWORDS":"Alternative splicing, Differential splicing, Dilated cardiomyopathy, Disease pathways, Functional enrichment, Multiple sclerosis, Platelet activation, Protein-protein interactions, Systems biology","AUTHOR":"Louadi, Zakaria and Elkjaer, Maria L. and Klug, Melissa and Lio, Chit Tong and Fenn, Amit and Illes, Zsolt and Bongiovanni, Dario and Baumbach, Jan and Kacprowski, Tim and List, Markus and Tsoy, Olga","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02538-1","JOURNAL":"Genome Biology","TITLE":"Functional enrichment of alternative splicing events with {NEASE} reveals insights into tissue identity and diseases","VOLUME":"22","FILE":"Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\IG3FBRYU\\\\Louadi 等。 - 2021 - Functional enrichment of alternative splicing even.pdf:application/pdf;Snapshot:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\XSZHKAKD\\\\s13059-021-02538-1.html:text/html","YEAR":"2021","URLDATE":"2022-02-18","DOI":"10.1186/s13059-021-02538-1"}},{"citationKey":"WU_CLUSTERPROFILER_2021","entryType":"ARTICLE","entryTags":{"MONTH":"August","ISSN":"2666-6758","NUMBER":"3","KEYWORDS":"biological knowledge mining, clusterProfiler, enrichment analysis, functional analysis, visualization","AUTHOR":"Wu, Tianzhi and Hu, Erqiang and Xu, Shuangbin and Chen, Meijun and Guo, Pingfan and Dai, Zehan and Feng, Tingze and Zhou, Lang and Tang, Wenli and Zhan, Li and Fu, Xiaocong and Liu, Shanshan and Bo, Xiaochen and Yu, Guangchuang","URL":"https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/abstract/S2666-6758(21)00066-7","NOTE":"Publisher: Elsevier","JOURNAL":"The Innovation","TITLE":"{clusterProfiler} 4.0: {A} universal enrichment tool for interpreting omics data","LANGUAGE":"English","VOLUME":"2","FILE":"Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\EHSAUGLL\\\\Wu 等。 - 2021 - clusterProfiler 4.0 A universal enrichment tool f.pdf:application/pdf;Snapshot:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\huangsh\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\PVI76IQU\\\\S2666-6758(21)00066-7.html:text/html","SHORTTITLE":"{clusterProfiler} 4.0","YEAR":"2021","URLDATE":"2021-11-03","DOI":"10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100141"}},{"citationKey":"YU_REACTOMEPA_2016","entryType":"ARTICLE","entryTags":{"ABSTRACT":"ReactomePA\n              is an R package providing functional analyses at the gene and sequence levels, with several visualization functions provided.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Reactome is a manually curated pathway annotation database for unveiling high-order biological pathways from high-throughput data.\n              ReactomePA\n              is an R/Bioconductor package providing enrichment analyses, including hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analyses.

However, it may produce a long list of significant terms with highly redundant information that is difficult to summarize. Current tools to simplify enrichment results by clustering them into groups either still produce redundancy between clusters or do not retain consistent term similarities within clusters. We propose a new method named binary cut for clustering similarity matrices of functional terms. Through comprehensive benchmarks on both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrated that binary cut can efficiently cluster functional terms into groups where terms showed more consistent similarities within groups and were more mutually exclusive between groups. We compared binary cut clustering on the similarity matrices obtained from different similarity measures and found that the semantic similarity worked well with binary cut while similarity matrices based on gene overlap showed less consistent patterns. We implemented the binary cut algorithm in the R package simplifyEnrichment which additionally provides functionalities for visualizing, summarizing and comparing the clusterings.","PAGES":"2020.10.27.312116","COPYRIGHT":"© 2021, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Results: The STREME algorithm presented here advances the state-of-the-art in ab initio motif discovery in terms of both accuracy and versatility. Using in vivo DNA (ChIP-seq) and RNA (CLIP-seq) data, and validating motifs with reference motifs derived from in vitro data, we show that STREME is more accurate, sensitive and thorough than several widely used algorithms (DREME, HOMER, MEME, Peak-motifs) and two other representative algorithms (ProSampler and Weeder). STREME’s capabilities include the ability to ﬁnd motifs in datasets with hundreds of thousands of sequences, to ﬁnd both short and long motifs (from 3 to 30 positions), to perform differential motif discovery in pairs of sequence datasets, and to ﬁnd motifs in sequences over virtually any alphabet (DNA, RNA, protein and user-deﬁned alphabets). Unlike most motif discovery algorithms, STREME reports a useful estimate of the statistical signiﬁcance of each motif it discovers. STREME is easy to use individually via its web server or via the command line, and is completely integrated with the widely used MEME Suite of sequence analysis tools.

Over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix.Results: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning DNA or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats, including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU.Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit.
