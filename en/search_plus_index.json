{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction Alternative splicing (AS) is pervasive and a key regulatory mechanism leading to diverse protein isoforms with distinct functions. Next-generation sequencing has enabled genome-wide studies of alternative splicing. However, AS analysis of the massive amount of transcriptomic data generated by RNA-Seq is challenging due to the limited functions of current software packages. A comprehensive and flexible pipeline for AS analysis is lacking. We present ASTK, a computational software integrating diverse tools to systematically analyze AS events: including clustering AS genes based on spliced exon lengths, functional enrichment analysis for spliced genes and spliced exons respectively, identifying binding motifs of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) surrounding splice sites, and charactering splicing-associated histone marks and chromatin signatures. ASTK was tested using experimental datasets to show its effectiveness and reliability. Together, ASTK will facilitate the functional characterization of AS events and improve our understanding of splicing regulation. "}}
